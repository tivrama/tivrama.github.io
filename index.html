  <h1 class="page-heading">Logging my journey with Telegraph Academy</h1>

  <p>At the beginning of this year, I began, in earnest, to pursue a new career in Software Engineering.  I knew I wanted to go to a coding boot camp, and had set my sights on Hack Reactor.  In preparation, I enrolled in a JavaScript course at UC Berkeley Extension.  But literally the week before the start of class, I found out about Telegraph Academy's Prep Plus course.  Way better deal.  And as I found out on the first day of class, way better suited for my needs and goals.  </p>

  <p>I ended up liking the Academy so much, I decided I would rather attend their program than the Hack Reactor school in San Francisco.  So now I am working my way through the pre-course work in order to attend the May session.  I am totally new to the tech world, so I have to make up a lot of ground.  Hopefully these blogs will help keep me focused and on track.  </p>
