I am a full stack software engineer experienced in JavaScript, React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, Mongo, and a host of associated JavaScript libraries.  But as much as I love walks on the beach, coding, and building full stack web apps, I also love data structures.  The blogs here will mostly address Data Structures and basic algorithmic challenges.
