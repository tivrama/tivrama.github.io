I am a full stack software engineer experienced in JavaScript, Angular, Node, Express, Mongo, Web Sockets, and a host of associated JavaScript libraries.

This is the home for my blog of coding stuff I find interesting.  But there is nothing too interesting on this readme.  Check out my blog [here](http://tivrama.github.io).
