Working on understanding the four basic data structures in JavaScript and how to work with them.  These are Functional, Functional Sharred, Prototypal, and Pseudoclassical.  I am deffinitly feeling the Pseudoclassical more at this point.  It looks way easier to use.  Fortunately, some of the seniors in in the cohort ahead, directed me to Ryan Atkinson's awsome blog on these very structures: [JavaScript Classes and Instantiation Patterns](http://www.ryanatkinson.io/javascript-instantiation-patterns/)

There's not much point in my repeating what is on his blog.  What I will say is that from my total noob perspective, I would lean towards using Pseudoclassical because it seem way more straight forward than all the others - with the exception of Functional.
