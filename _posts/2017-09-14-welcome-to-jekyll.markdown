### GitHub Universe

First day at Gidhub Universe.  Keynote speker and founder Chris Wanstrath introduced new features to GitHub and its workflow

There was a shord talk on BASIC git work flow in the Twitter Flight room.  A little surprising how many people there were not totaly familiar with Git workflow.  Still - learned about the now Trellio like board and assignments.  Had not seen that before.  This went live today - and the GitHub page looks diferent.  Most immediate diff is the pinned repositories.  You can also now have 6.  

More sparsely attended than I thought it would have been.  Cool free stuff.  

The space is devided into sever section.  But the main is the key note presentation area.  Second largest is the lunch area.  There are surrounding hubs that are owned by other industries.  They I am currenly in th the Heroku section - eyeing bins of cool T-shirts.  

Overly large, these areas look somewhat underpopulated - perhaps that was the ticket proce.  It is certainly undersold.  And overall, the energy is somwwhat muted.
